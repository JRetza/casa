	<shortdescription>Feathering: Combine two images using the Fourier Addition</shortdescription>
	<description>
The algorithm converts each image to the gridded visibility
plane, combines them, and reconverts them into an combined
image.  The images must have a well-defined beam shape (clean beam),
given in the image, in order for feathering to work well.
The two images must be on the same grid and have the same
flux density normalization scale.

<example>

	Feathering: Combine two images using the Fourier Addition:
	
	The algorithm converts each image to the gridded visibility
	plane, combines them, and reconverts them into an combined
	image.  The images must have a well-defined beam shape (clean beam),
	given in the image, in order for feathering to work well.
	The two images must be on the same grid and have the same
	flux density normalization scale.

	Keyword arguments:
        imagename -- Name of output feathered image
                default: none; example: imagename='orion_combined'
        highres -- Name of high resolution (interferometer) image
                default: none; example: imagename='orion_vla.im'
	     This image is often a clean image obtained from synthesis
		observations.
        lowres -- Name of low resolution (single dish) image
                default: none; example: imagename='orion_gbt.im'
	     This image is often a image from a single-dish oobservations
	        or a clean image obtained from a lower resolution synthesis
		observations.
