  <shortdescription>Convert old-style caltables into new-style caltables.\n</shortdescription>

  <description>
    This task converts old-style caltables into new-style caltables.  It is
    provided as a convenience and is strictly temporary.  The information
    transferred should be enough for most calibration purposes.  BPOLY and
    GSPLINE versions are not supported.  Only simple bugs will be fixed.  If
    there are other issues, it is suggested that a new-style caltable be
    created.

  <example>
    This task converts old-style caltables into new-style caltables.  It is
    provided as a convenience and is strictly temporary.  The information
    transferred should be enough for most calibration purposes.  BPOLY and
    GSPLINE versions are not supported.  Only simple bugs will be fixed.  If
    there are other issues, it is suggested that a new-style caltable be
    created.

    Arguments:

    caltab_old -- Name of the old-style caltable.
    default: none
    example: caltab_old='gronk.g0'

    vis -- Name of the visibility file (MS) associated with the old-style
        caltable.
    default: none
    example: vis='blurp.ms'

    ptype -- Type of data in the new-format caltable.
    default: "complex"; allowed values: "complex" or "float"
    example: ptype="complex"

    NB: The old-style caltables do not have this information, so it is
    imperative that users get it correct.  "complex" refers to caltables that
    have complex gains (e.g., produced by gaincal, bpcal, etc.).  "float" refers
    to caltables that real numbers such as delays (e.g., produced by gencal).

    caltab_new -- Name of the new-style caltable.
    default: "" --> the suffix ".new" is appended to the name of the old-style
        caltable
    example: caltab_old='gronk_new.g0'
