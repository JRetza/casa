<task type="function" name="fixvis">

<shortdescription> Performs visibility adjustments. </shortdescription>
<description>
     This corrects visibilities, and/or their (u, v, w) positions, for various
     effects that can be calculated without fitting a model to the data.

     The effects include:
     \begin{itemize}
       \item calculating (u, v, w) coordinates,
       \item changing the phase tracking center(s),
       \item correcting for differential aberration,
       \item changing the equinox (i.e. B1950 to J2000 or 2006.78),
       \item changing the projection, as in (-)NCP to SIN.  (Not yet implemented),
       \item refocusing.
     \end{itemize}

<example>
This task allows the user to adjust or correct the visibilities, including
their (u, v, w) coordinates, for various effects which do not require
fitting a model to the data.  (i.e. This is not a calibrater.)

The effects are:
  calculating (u, v, w) coordinates,
  changing the phase tracking center(s),
  correcting for differential aberration,
  changing the equinox (i.e. B1950 to J2000 or 2006.78),
  changing the projection, as in (-)NCP to SIN.  (Not yet implemented),
  and refocusing to a finite distance.

Input Parameters:

vis  --- Name of input visibility file
         ex: vis='my.ms'

outputvis --- Name of the output visibility set.  (Can be the same as vis.)
              ex: outputvis = 'myrefocused.ms'

fields    --- Selection string for the fields to operate on.  '' = all.

<!-- </description> -->

<!-- <example> -->
Example:

fixvis(vis='my.ms', outputvis='myrefocused.ms', '')
