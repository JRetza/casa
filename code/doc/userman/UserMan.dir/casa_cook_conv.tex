\chapter[Appendix: Conventions and Parameters]
         {Conventions and Parameters}
\label{chapter:conventions}

This chapter lists the available parameters, conventions, and
reference frames in CASA.

\section{Velocity Reference Frames}
\label{section:conv.vel}

The velocity frames supportedin CASA are:
me.listcodes(me.frequency())

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf REST} --- Laboratory
\item {\bf LSRK} --- local standard of rest (kinematic)
\item {\bf LSRD} --- local standard of rest (dynamic)
\item {\bf BARY} --- barycentric
\item {\bf GEO} --- geocentric
\item {\bf TOPO} --- topocentric
\item {\bf GALACTO} --- galactocentric
\item {\bf LGROUP} --- Local Group
\item {\bf CMB} --- cosmic microwave background dipole
\end{itemize}

The same list can be accessed from teh toolkit as {\tt me.listcodes(me.frequency())}.

\section{Time Reference Frames}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf LAST} ---

\item {\bf GMST1} ---  

\item {\bf GAST} ---  

\item {\bf UT1} ---  

\item {\bf UT2} ---
