The capability for simulating observations and datasets from the EVLA
and ALMA are an important use-case for CASA.  This not only allows one
to get an idea of the capabilities of these instruments for doing
science, but also provides benchmarks for the performance and utility
of the software for processing ``realistic'' datasets (with
atmospheric and instrumental effects).  CASA can now calculate
visibilities (create a measurement set) for any interferometric array,
and calculate and apply calibration tables representing some of the
most important corrupting effects.  Version 3.0.0 now also contains a
{\em beta} version of a task to simulate single dish or total power
data from the same sky model as interferometric data.

     \centerline{\bf Inside the Toolkit:}
     The simulator methods are in the {\tt sm} tool.
     Many of the other tools are also helpful when
     constructing and analyzing simulations.

CASA's simulation capabilities have been under development, and will
likely continue to evolve through this and the next release of CASA.

Observations in CASA''.

Following general CASA practice, the greatest flexibility and richest
functionality is at the Toolkit level.  The most commonly used
procedures for interferometric simulation are encapsulated in the {\tt
  simdata} task.  Total power simulation is possible at the task level
using the {\tt sdsimdata} task, which follows somewhat parallel inputs
and whose capabilities will being developed more fully in the next
release.

%{\bf BETA ALERT:} The simulation capabilities are currently under
%development.  What we do have is mostly at the Toolkit level.
%We have only a single task {\tt almasimmos} at the present time.
%Stay tuned.  For the Beta Release, we include this chapter
%in the Appendix for the use of telescope commissioners and software
%developers.

This task takes an input model image or list of components, plus a
list of antennas (locations and sizes), and simulates a particular
observation (specifies by mosaic setup and observing cycles and
times).  The output is a MS suitable for further analysis in CASA, a
synthesized image create from those visibilities, a difference image
between the synthesized image and your sky model convolved with the
output synthesized beam, and a fidelity image.

Random thermal noise (from the atmosphere and receiver) can optionally
be added. A realistic model of the troposphere is created from known
site characteristics (altitude, etc) and used to calculate the
frequency dependence of the noise.  Similarly, specifications for ALMA
and EVLA receiver temperature and antenna efficiencies are coded into
the task to determine a realistic system temperature.  Other
corrupting effects, such as phase noise, gain drift, and
cross-polarization, can be added the the MS with the toolkit - see the
web documentation for more information.
