Some Subversion 3rd party tools fail to merge changes between branches that do 
not strictly comply with Subversion branching conventions.

Create project branches in 

https://svn.cv.nrao.edu/svn/casa/branches/project-[descriptive name]

where [descriptive name] describes the purpose of the branch.

This will allow more flexibility in choosing tools to merge work on that 
branch to the CASA trunk or other branches.
