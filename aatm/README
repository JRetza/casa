AATM ReadMe File
================


Why "A"ATM
----------

ATM is a package most recently maintained and developed by Juan
Pardo. I wanted to have a slightly different name in case Juan wants
to relase code under name "ATM" and then we have a name
clash. 

Is AATM the same as ATM?
------------------------

AATM aims to track very closely the version of ATM as supplied by Juan
Pardo for the ALMA online calibration software "TelCal". There are
other versions of ATM around -- some written in Fortran, etc., and
this package can of course only be close to one of them.


Dependencies
------------

ATM itself has no external dependencies. However the build of this
package depends on BOOST libraries because it is used in the test
program(s) in the "test" sub-directory.


Directory Structure
-------------------

tests: These are revised tests, to make them easier to understand

otest: These are the orignal tests as in ALMA CVS 

Notes on the code
-----------------

ATMAtmosphereType.cpp
`````````````````````

Appears to be a small test program -- exclude from library build


Synchornising with the ALMA CVS Version
---------------------------------------

These are notes for my own use -- they show how to directly pull the
files from the CVS layout.

rsync -r appcs:/home/bn204/d/almasw5/TELCAL/TelCalResults/Libraries/ATM/include/ src/ --exclude 'Makefile' --exclude '.cvsignore' --exclude "CVS"

rsync -r appcs:/home/bn204/d/almasw5/TELCAL/TelCalResults/Libraries/ATM/src/ src/ --exclude 'Makefile' --exclude '.cvsignore' --exclude "CVS"
