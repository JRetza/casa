AATM ToDo List
==============

* BUGS

** Copy behaviour

*** std::vector<> parameters should be taken as const & , _not coppied_

*** std::vector<> types should not be returned as copies

** Const correctness 
   
- class SpectralGrid has no const memebers -- many of the assers at
  least should be const

** Features

*** RefractiveIndexProfile should be constructable without spectral windows
** Namespace issues
*** There must not be "using namespace std" at top level in header files
*** Must not include a file at level other than top-level

    e.g.: ATMAtmosphereType.h line 22
