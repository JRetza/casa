AATM News
=========

Version 0.5
-----------

Correct a memory leak. Initial work to support averageing over channel
width.

Version 0.4.3.1
---------------

Fix bug in the "absorption" test program which was causing incorrect
opacities. No changes to the main library.

Version 0.4.3
-------------

Fix a bug causing a segmantation fault at certain lower pressures
(when gcc 4.4 family is used at least). This is related ALMA CSV-526.

Version 0.4.2
-------------

Fix to small discontinuity in the opacities as a function of
frequencies.  Some lines were not taken into account to save
computational time when they should have been
(ATMRefractiveIndex.cpp).

Fixed an issue which can sometimes produce a crash in the DSB mode
(ATMSpectralGrid.cpp).

Version 0.4.1
-------------

Fixed a bug in ATMSpectralGrid.cpp: the frequencies of the image band
(DSB mode) were wrong when the spectral grid was defined from a LSB
band with negative resolution or an USB band with positive resolution.

Version 0.3
-----------

* Merge the changes from Juan's upstream code. This version correspond
  exactly to ALMA release XXXX

Version 0.2
-----------

Improvements:

* <stdio.h> includes satisfy new versions of g++ (Bug #479022)

* Zero humidity does not cause a crash (Bug #463154)

* Fix typo in  InverseLength::sget  (Bug #387670)

* RefractiveIndex::getRefractivity_o2 now calls 16o17o (Bug #387672)

* Correct the destructor in RefractiveIndexProfile 

* SpectralGrid::getBandwidth(unsigned int spwId) now uses swpid
  argument (Bug #387673)

Version 0.1
-----------

Improvements:

* Test programs dispersive and absorption now take into account the
  non-linearity in conversion of pwv to relative humidty. This
  resolves a small (~1%) problem with derivatives of path/absorption
  at high relative humidities.

* Test program "dispersive" now prints results with higher precision
  to allow more accurate derivative calculations


UPSTREAM TRACKING:

* ATMTemperature takes Faranhait as units (?)

* When fitting for coupling, there is a check that it doesn't exceed 1

* Removal of some dead code 

* A number of functions in ATMProfile have been moved out-of-line and
  into the implementation file

* Algorigthm changes in ATMProfile

* Constructor in ATMPercent.cpp changed to reckognise the word "percent"

* Constructor in ATMOpacity changed to reckognise words neper

* Chnages to contructors in ATMLength

Version 0.09
------------

Bug fixes:

* On certain compilers static const memebers in SMATest were not being
  compiled correctly, so replaced them with non-static members

Version 0.08
------------

UPSTREAM TRACKING:

Synchronised with the current version of ATM in the ALMA CVS
Trunk. Some changes that occurred due to this synchronisation:

* Some function names with "Wet" in their name changed to "H2O" in
  their name.

* File "ATMTypeName.h" has been removed -- no more class AtmosphereType

* Files ATMAtmosphereType.h and ATMAtmosphereType.cpp have been removed

* Fiels ATMType.h and ATMType.cpp have been removed

* Atmosphere types are now specified by an unsigned integer *only*.
  See AtmProfile::getAtmosphereType() for descriptions.

OTHER CHANGES:

* Improvements to the test programs "dispersive" and "absorption"


Version 0.07
------------

Building:

* Use more modern boost autoconf macros which should make it easier to
  build on a variety of platforms

Version 0.06
------------

New features:

* Command line program "dispersive" which computes the dispersive
  delay for a simple atmosphere illustrative of the AOS site

* Command line program "absorption" similar to above but computing the
  absorption


Version 0.05
------------

This is the first public release version.
