Requirements
============

* scons >= 1.1
* rpfits >= 2.19
* cfitso >= 2
* python >= 2.4
* boost >= 1.37
* casacore >= 1.0

Installation
============

scons has several targets. It is recommended to execute them sequentially.
The normal install procedure is as follows
.. code::

   scons
   scons makedist=1
   cd asap-4.1.0
   python setup.py install
   asap # exit with <Ctrl-D>

Obtaining the data directory
============================

The data repository can be obtained separately after installing ASAP.
Before you run asap for the first time simply run::

    asap_update_data

This will install the data repository into the correct location.

Creating a binary distribution
==============================

after building using 'scons', you can create a compressed tarball of the binaries. This is done via the target 'makedist='. The argument should be an obvious identifier for the system you want to support, e.g. 'sarge' or 'fc5-x86_64'::

    python setup.py bdist_egg

This will create an archive in the subdirectory 'dist' named 'asap-X.Y.Z-py2.Negg', where X,Y,Z are the version numbers e.g 4.1.0.
