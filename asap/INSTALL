Requirements
============

* scons >= 1.1
* rpfits >= 2.19
* cfitso >= 2
* python >= 2.4
* boost >= 1.37
* casacore >= 1.0

Installation
============

scons has several targets. It is recommended to execute them sequentially.
The normal install procedure is as follows
.. code::

   scons
   # Do this if you haven't got a measures data directory already
   export ASAPDATA=.
   ./bin/asap_update_data
   #
   scons install

Obtaining the data directory
============================

The data repository can be obtained separately after installing ASAP.
Before you run asap for the first time simply run::

    asap_update_data

This will install the data repository into the correct location.

There are several ways to do this. 
a) If you already have the 'data' directory, copy it to the root directory and run the normal install procedure::

   scons
   scons install

b) You can obtain the data repository from the ftp site.
   Simply run::

   	export ASAPDATA=.
     	./bin/asap_update_data

   This will retrieve and unpack the data directory.
   After this run:: 

   	scons install

Creating a binary distribution
==============================

after building using 'scons', you can create a compressed tarball of the binaries. This is done via the target 'makedist='. The argument should be an obvious identifier for the system you want to support, e.g. 'sarge' or 'fc5-x86_64'::

    scons makedist=sarge

This will create an archive in the subdirectory 'dist' named 'asap-X.Y.Z-sarge.tar.bz2', where X,Y,Z are the version numbers e.g 2.1.0.
