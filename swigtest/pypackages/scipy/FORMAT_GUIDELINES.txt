Follow the standard Python formatting rules when writing code for SciPy.  Guido 
describes them "here":http://www.python.org/doc/essays/styleguide.html.  A few 
reminders follow:

   o Use 4 spaces for indentation levels.  Do not use tabs as they can result 
     in indentation confusion.  Most editors have a feature that will insert 4 
     spaces when the tab key is hit.  Also, many editors will automatically 
     search/replace leading tabs with 4 spaces.

   o Only 80 characters on a line.

   o use all lowercase function names with underscore separated words:

        def set_some_value()

     instead of:

        def setSomeValue()


   o use CamelCase class names:

        def BaseClass()

     instead of:

        def base_class()
