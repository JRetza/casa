Requirements
============

* scons

Installation
============

scons has several targets. It is recommended to execute them sequentially.
The normal install procedure is as follows:
   . <path_to_casa_asap>/aipsinit.sh
   scons
   # Do this if you haven't got a data directory already
   export ASAPDATA=.
   ./bin/asap_update_data
   #
   scons install


Obtaining the data directory
============================
The data repository can be obtained seperately after installing ASAP.
Before you run asap for the first time simply run
    asap_update_data
This will install the data repository into the correct location.

There are several ways to do this. 
a) If you already hae the 'data' directory, copy it to the root directory and run the normal install procedure.
   scons
   scons install

b) You can obtain the data repository from the ftp site.
   Simply run 
   	export ASAPDATA=.
     	./bin/asap_update_data
   This will retrieve and unpack the data directory.
   After this run: 
   	scons install

Creating a binary distribution
==============================

after building using 'scons', you can create a compressed tarball of the binaries. This is done via the target 'makedist='. The argument should be an obvious identifier for the system you want to support, e.g. 'sarge' or 'fc5-x86_64'

    scons makedist=sarge

This will create an archive in the subdirectory 'dist' named 'asap-X.Y.Z-sarge.tar.bz2', where X,Y,Z are the version numbers e.g 2.1.0.
