\chapter{Parallel Processing in CASA}
\label{chapter:parallel}


CASA is currently being optimized for parallel processing on
multi-core and/or multi-node computer infrastructure. The goal is to
deliver code that is flexible enough to run on single workstations
with multi-core CPUs up to high-performance cumputer clusters. 

The development is ongoing and since progress is fast, we would like
to point to a CASAguides webpage that contains the latest instructions:

The CASA Reference Manual will be updated here once the parallelization has
more matured.
